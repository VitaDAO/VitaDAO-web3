## Responsibilities

We maintainers need to remember that VitaDAO is an organization focused on science. We are here to keep things working and to make less technical people comfortable using web3 and blockchain governance. Assume *ZERO* knowledge on the part of our users. Make everything easy by default, and even when you succeed doing that you still need to explain it using text or tooltips.

**We are responsible for our user's confidence using our site and contracts.**

This is crypto, but for a meaningful cause. The tech is not the point, let's keep it out of the way. 

## Inclusion

We contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in [VitaDao's](https://vitadao.com) project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
